CODE STANDARD
***********************

Code structure:

All program code should be contained within a "main" function.

Variables:

Names should be descriptive and unambiguous. They should be formatted in lower camel case, save for variables that describe the same functionality with different data (see: our questionnaire algorithm), in which case differential markings should be appeneded to the end of the name (ex. quest_d_1, quest_a_2, quest_b_3). Variables that describe constants should be written in all uppercase (caps). 

Strings:

Absolutely, under no circumstances, DO NOT use the percent string form operator.

Formatting:

There should be one line of space between expressions (ex. y = x + 1 as opposed to y=x+1). Code should be indented according to standard Python coding practice. Functions with long amounts of code should be formatted on separate lines. 

Comments:

Comments explaining a function should be indented and tabbed above the function. Comments concerning issues or user comments should be indented and tabbed below the function.
